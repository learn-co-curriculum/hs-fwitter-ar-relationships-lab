## Let's Create Direct Messages

Time to take those active record skills to the next level and start tracking direct messages. A create messages migration has been created for you - you'll just need to run `rake db:migrate` to create a table with columns for sender id, receiver id and a message. A message model has also been created but you'll need to set up the following relationships:

+ User has many 
  * sent messages
  * received messages

+ Messages belong to 
  * senders
  * receivers

You'll need to use aliasing to accomplish this. Let's take a look at another example for a site like AirBNB with the following relationships:

+ User has many 
  * reservations as a guest
  * reservations as a host

+ Reservations belong to 
  * guests
  * hosts

Here is an example of how we would aliasing to establish these relationships:

```ruby
class Reservation < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :guest, :class_name => "User"
  belongs_to :host, :class_name => "User"

end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :reservations_as_guest, :class_name => "Reservation", 
           :foreign_key => "guest_id"
  has_many :reservations_as_host, :class_name => "Reservation", 
           :foreign_key => "host_id"

end
```

Try following this pattern to set up the relationship between users and messages in the app, then test it out in tux.

Once you've got your models set up and working, work on the views and controller and get those direct messages displayed in the app.

### Bonus Challenge!

Let's start tracking followers!

This is a little trickier but Michael Hartl has a good explanation of how to set this up in his Rails tutorial here: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/following_users#sec-a_problem_with_the_data_model

This is a problem worth learning how to handle because there are many apps where users take on multiple roles - like AirBnB, eBay (users can be both buyers and sellers) or even potentially Uber (maybe a driver wants to hire a car on his day off!).
